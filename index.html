        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="./assets/images/headshot.png" alt="headshot photo">

        <p>I'm a junior full stack web developer with a passion for coding, absorbing new skills, and collaborating with other
          people. I'm looking to join an experienced and talented engineering team focused on challenging, meaningful, and
          interesting projects that I can contribute to while also learning and growing as a developer.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I previously worked at an e-commerce startup from the ground floor. I started as a Content Writer and transitioned
          into a management role, heading the written content department as Lead Editor. I was also responsible for general
          SEO maintenance including best on-page practices and outreach for off-page SEO.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>As a means to facilitate content creation, I taught myself basic HTML and CSS to code and style articles for the
          company's website. I soon became fascinated with the entire coding process from developing the original idea to
          the final working product. I learned to embrace the rollercoaster of coding. Working in this environment, I began
          to understand the painful hours spent searching for the best solutions as well as the euphoria of publishing a
          finished page I could be proud of. It was clear to me that my career path should involve coding, and enrolling
          in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was the first step to achieve my goal.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I bring to any endeavor complete and focused dedication, the ability to work with others as part of a team, and a
          flexible mindset for achieving the success of any project.</p>
